Question
QUESTION 1
==========

Using C#.

Given an array of integers, find the one numerically closest to zero with the following exceptions:
  - Do NOT include zero itself
  - If a positive and negative number are an equal distance from zero, the positive number should be returned

BASE CODE TO START WITH (Please resplace the TODO with your solution)
=====================================================================

using System;

namespace ClosestToZero
{
    public class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Closest to Zero");
            Console.WriteLine();

            Console.WriteLine("Problem:");
            Console.WriteLine("Given an array of integers, find the one closest to zero, not including zero itself.");
            Console.WriteLine("If a positive and negative number tie, the positive number should be returned.");
            Console.WriteLine();

            Console.WriteLine("Example:");
            Console.WriteLine("Input: [4, 3, -10, 4, 0, 3, -2, -5, 8]");
            Console.WriteLine("Output: -2");
            Console.WriteLine();

            int[] testArray = { 4, 3, -10, 4, 3, 0, -2, -5, 8 };
            Console.WriteLine("Your output: " + ClosestToZero(testArray));

            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to close...");
            Console.Read();
        }

        public static int ClosestToZero(int[] input)
        {
            // TODO: Implement your logic here

            return 0;
        }
    }
}
